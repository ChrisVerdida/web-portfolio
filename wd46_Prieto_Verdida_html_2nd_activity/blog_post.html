                    Web developers are expected to have certain skills and demonstrate their ability to deliver 
                    everything on time. So, if you want to master web developer duties, you need to have particular 
                    skills, which involve the following technical skills: Coding: knowing common programming languages 
                    like PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Java, etc. Responsive design: you need to make sure a website 
                    looks great on different devices. Technical SEO: understand what website design factors affect the 
                    site's search engine ranking. Version control: know how to control and track changes without starting 
                    from the beginning. Visual design: be familiar with basic design principles. Let's not forget workplace 
                    skills because they are equally important. You have to be good at communicating with others, 
                    detailed-oriented, organized, able to solve problems and achieve the best results to satisfy the 
                    demands of end-users.

                    Working hours. Most web developers are employed full-time, which typically translates to 40 hours a week, 
                    eight hours a day. Additionally, some of them work overtime to complete projects on time. Web developers 
                    can also be freelancers, which means they get to determine their business hours. Unless you are working 
                    for a company, your working hours will vary significantly and mostly depend on the project. Happiness level. 
                    Are web developers happy? The simple answer is: it all depends on the circumstances. Besides practical perks, 
                    like having an in-demand skill set, many non-monetary benefits are linked to this job. According to some 
                    estimates, this was the eighth-best job in 2018, and freelancers find it extremely rewarding and satisfying, 
                    especially when they have a chance to balance their work with other life activities. You set your schedule, 
                    work anywhere with Wi-Fi, work from home in your pajamas, and spend more time with your family.

                    Stress level. Like any other job, this one also carries specific responsibilities and risks. Stress is 
                    definitely something to count in when you weigh the pros and cons of being a web developer. Alongside 
                    general stressors like time, complex coding, and demanding clients, developers need to satisfy certain 
                    art criteria. To succeed in this industry, you need to work really hard and face all challenges that 
                    come your way, especially if you are working for a company. Freelancers can expect less pressure in 
                    terms of management. They can focus only on job-related tasks without having to satisfy bosses at the 
                    same time. Repetitiveness. Is web development fun, or will it bore you to tears? The short answer to 
                    the second question is no! Of course, it all depends on whom you are asking, but you need to keep in 
                    mind that personal preferences vary significantly. Coding is not boring because it offers you so many 
                    options. You can develop skills you never knew you had. Many web developers say that codes are directly 
                    linked to tangible rewards you can't find in any field, mostly when you develop product features and fixes
                    based on people's real needs. Market demand. Web developers are high in demand, and according to some 
                    estimates, the demand will increase up to 13% within the next decade. Due to the increase in internet and
                    web technologies, this occupation demands more professionals to ensure the quality of products and services. 
                    Several companies and industries employ web developers, some of which might not have hired them in the past. 
                    Additionally, a significant increase in startup companies and small businesses enabled web developers to 
                    find jobs nearly anywhere, making this career choice even more appealing, especially when you know how long 
                    it takes to learn web development.
