                    <p>
                        We've all heard people who say that pets are “just” animals, as though somehow they're not important 
                        in our lives. These people have likely never owned a loyal dog or loving cat and their words couldn't 
                        be further from the truth. Most pet owners will know how wonderful owning an animal can be; they will 
                        understand the companionship and how beautiful bonds can be formed between animal and human. Did you 
                        know that it has been scientifically proven that stroking an animal can greatly reduce your stress levels? 
                        If you spend around 15 minutes petting your favorite cat or dog, your body will release the following 
                        natural “feel good” hormones: oxytocin, prolactin and serotonin. It also lowers your cortisol, which is 
                        the body's natural stress hormone. Not only will this send your body into a relaxed state, but it can also 
                        lower your blood pressure by 10% too. If you own a dog, then you will have to walk it at least once or twice 
                        a day which means you will be getting vital fresh air and exercise while having the opportunity to connect
                        with nature and bond with your four-legged friend. Animals do not ask for much in life, and 
                        most just need a warm, safe and sheltered place to live, as well as adequate food, water and 
                        exercise. In return they will give you unconditional love, loyalty and companionship. Dogs are 
                        a little more well known to offer unconditional love; cats can be a little fickle! But having 
                        a furry friend means you will always have a little living being, waiting patiently for you at 
                        home and ready to welcome you with a wagging tail or a purr.

                        It's incredible just how much support an animal can bring to your life. As 
                        MyPetNeedsThat mentions, if you are particularly vulnerable or have special 
                        needs then there are certain dog breeds that are perfect at providing emotional 
                        and physical support. A dog or cat can help with loneliness, give you companionship 
                        and someone to talk to, and sit with you during the evenings. Pets can be lifesavers 
                        when it comes to depression and grief. They can give you a sense of purpose and a 
                        reason to get out of bed when you are feeling particularly depressed or anxious. 
                        Animals such as cats and dogs can have a deeply calming effect on humans and can 
                        often pick up on their owner's moods: snuggling up to you when you are feeling sad or 
                        licking your hands if they sense that you have anxiety.Owning a pet can open up your world. 
                        If you have a dog, then you will have to walk it daily, which means that you will have 
                        interactions with other dog owners and walkers too. This can help with loneliness in 
                        people who find it difficult to make friends. Playing with a cat or a dog can take your 
                        mind away from your problems and place you in the “here and now.” This is basic mindfulness 
                        and wonderful for mental health. In summary, owning a pet will change your life and bring 
                        you so much joy and love. They help us gain a sense of responsibility, show us unconditional 
                        love, and are always there when we need them. Dogs are more high maintenance but bring many 
                        different health benefits, whereas cats, rabbits and gerbils are easy to look after, need 
                        little exercise and give our lives new meaning and purpose.
